Karton is an open source project and I'm glad to accept bug reports or help with code, documentation and testing.

* You can look for currently open issues and report new ones on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/karton/karton/issues).
* Get the code from [GitHub (click the “Clone or download” link)](https://github.com/karton/karton).
* Read the coding guidelines (FIXME).
* This website is kept on a different repository called [karton.github.io](https://github.com/karton/karton.github.io/).
